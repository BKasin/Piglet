Runnable setups for Piglet.  These are what you launch in visual boy advance.

I may not include some of these in the future - I've been thinking about stuff to lock down that wouldn't be annoying to people who are looking at the source to learn but would still keep a little bit of control for me.  Having a special piglet setup might accomplish that...  not sure.  At the moment, I'm uploading stuff though.
