She uses a variety of methods to accomplish this, including evolutionary models and crude implementations of Bayes Theorem.\r\n\r\n##**What does that mean?**\r\n\r\nPiglet attempts to play games without any input from humans at all.  That includes information about what buttons, what her goals should be, or the inner mechanics of the game itself.   Piglet figures all of that stuff out on her own.\r\n\r\nThe video above shows footage that was recorded with literally no human input.","google":"UA-54331894-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
